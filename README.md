Max Life Insurance, a leading health insurance provider in India, aims to enhance its business model by identifying health insurance policyholders likely to purchase vehicle insurance. The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that enables targeted marketing, improves cross-selling opportunities, and increases revenue by personalizing outreach efforts.

By leveraging machine learning, this project seeks to analyze demographic, vehicle-related, and policy-specific attributes to predict the probability of a customerâ€™s interest in vehicle insurance. An accurate model will empower Max Life Insurance to optimize resource allocation, focus on high-potential leads, and improve customer experience by offering relevant products.

The dataset includes various attributes related to customer demographics, vehicle details, and policy-related information, such as:

**Demographic Features**: Gender, Age, Region Code Type

**Vehicle Information**: Vehicle Age, History of Vehicle Damage

**Policy Details**: Annual Premium, Policy Sourcing Channel

**Other Attributes**: Additional behavioral and categorical insights contributing to the likelihood of interest in vehicle insurance

Next I implemented three machine learning algorithms namely, 'LogisticRegression', 'RandomForestClassifier','XGBClassifier'.The ROC-AUC scores for all models ranged between 80% and 95%. Among them, the Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest ROC-AUC score of 94%, making it the final model choice. This model provides a strong balance between accuracy and interpretability, ensuring better predictive performance for business decisions.
